So , I created a small-scale election system in which first of all after conpling the contract, you have to give the name of the candidates taking part in the election, after which the contract will be deployed.

You need to enter the age of the voter to ensure his/her verification.A voter will be able to cast his/her vote only if he/she is 18 years old.Then type the index of the candidate whom you want to cast the vote.

Lastly, there is function that will declare the name of the winner of the election.
